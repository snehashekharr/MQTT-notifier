# MQTT Notifier

-MQTT Notifier is a Spring Boot application built to demonstrate the use of the MQTT protocol for real-time communication. It acts as an MQTT client that connects to a broker, subscribes to a specific topic, and listens for messages published on that topic. The application can also be extended to publish messages to MQTT topics.

-This project was created to understand how MQTT, a lightweight publish-subscribe network protocol, integrates with backend applications in use cases like IoT, messaging systems, and real-time dashboards. It offers an example of how Java and Spring Boot can be used to build efficient and responsive communication channels between devices or services.

-The application uses the Eclipse Paho MQTT client library to connect to an MQTT broker, such as HiveMQ or Mosquitto. When the application starts, it initializes a connection to the broker using properties defined in the configuration file. It subscribes to a specified topic and waits for messages. Any messages received are logged to the console.

-To run the project, clone the repository and open it in IntelliJ IDEA. You can configure the broker details in the `application.properties` file under `src/main/resources`. Once configured, you can run the application through the IDE or by using the `mvn spring-boot:run` command in the terminal.

-The application establishes a connection with the broker, subscribes to the configured topic, and logs any received messages. It provides a foundational setup that can be extended further to include publishing capabilities or integration with other services.
